# ReactJS Study plan projects

## Projects

### 1. React router DOM and protected routes with Zustand

Small project to test react router DOM with protected routes, and using Zustand to emulate a login state of a user.

### 2 - react router DOM With Router Provider

I based this project from the first one, but in this case, I used the RouterProvider and createBrowserRouter approach.

The code is different, but the createBrowserRouter allows us to use some methods to preload data from APIs.

### 3 - NextJS App router app example

NextJS application with single router management, using app folder to test react server components approach.

### 4 - ReactJS Context and reducer

ReactJS app, that is using the context API with a reducer in order to share state across multiple components.

There's also an option to use state and setState in order to avoid reducer option.

### 5 - ReactJS 360 Pano Office

React JS app integration with Marzipano (Google) to display a 360 Experience of my office and my house 3 floor.
