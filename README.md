# ReactJS Study plan projects

## Projects

### 1. React router DOM and protected routes with Zustand

Small project to test react router DOM with protected routes, and using Zustand to emulate a login state of a user.

### 2 - react router DOM With Router Provider

I based this project from the first one, but in this case, I used the RouterProvider and createBrowserRouter approach.

The code is different, but the createBrowserRouter allows us to use some methods to preload data from APIs.
