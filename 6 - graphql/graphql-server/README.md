## GraphQL API

This is a GraphQL Api connected to a json-server api data mock.

To run the api do the following:

1. In a console run `npm run json-server`
2. Open another console and run: `npx nodemon src/index.js` (This will probably ask you to install nodemon globally only the first time.)
3. Go to http://localhost:4000/ and test the GraphQL Api.
