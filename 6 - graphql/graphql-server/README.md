## GraphQL API

This is a GraphQL Api connected to a json-server api data mock.

To run the api do the following:

1. Make sure you have mongoDB installed as we need to connect to a local DB. you can also update the string connection to point to mongo atlas.
1. Open another console and run: `npm run dev` (This will probably ask you to install nodemon globally only the first time.)
1. Go to http://localhost:4000/ and test the GraphQL Api.
